# Sorting Visualizer

Sorting Visualizer is an interactive and educational tool designed to help users understand how different sorting algorithms work. This project provides visual representations of various sorting techniques, making it easier to grasp their inner workings and compare their performance.

## Features

- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms:**
  - Bubble Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Heap Sort
- **Interactive Controls:**
  - Adjust array size and sorting speed.
  - Shuffle the array.
  - Generate a random array and the visualize the Sorting Algorithm.
- **Real-Time Visualization:**
  - Watch each step of the algorithm as it processes the array.
  - Dynamic bar graphs representing the array.
- **Algorithm Descriptions:**
  - Short explanations of each algorithm, including their time and space complexities.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript
  - ReactJs


## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NAGACHAITANYAKAPU/Sorting-Algorithms-Visualizer.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
